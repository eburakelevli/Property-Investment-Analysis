House prices are closely linked with economic development. People all around the world uses real estate as a part of their investment portfolio. There are a lot of work done on models which predicts the prices with very high accuracy however there is a large group of investors, interested in knowing which houses are in high demand or the ones which will go off the market sooner. A model is needed which not only predicts the price but also give insight on the demand of the house. With this study, model is developed to predict the price as well as the features are explored which are linked with properties that are likely to be sold fast,  get the features to defer which contributes to higher demand on the houses. Different machine learning algorithms has been used such as linear regression, random  forest, decision tree and stochastic gradient descent regressor for the price forecast and demand forecast. Solutions are designed for the investors with interest in different categories such as high value asset, medium and fast-moving asset, low value up scalable asset. R2 score of %88 has been reached with the training data set. The model have been validated using K-fold. Together with the price and the demand forecast, the solution that produced as a results of this project can be beneficial for the investors in different categories.![image](https://github.com/eburakelevli/Property-Investment-Analysis/assets/109799374/245edd23-802e-4ffb-a2ef-5780d2c6cb49)
